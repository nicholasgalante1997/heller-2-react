# Typography - Body

The `<Body />` component is a `Typography` component that's intended for use in paragraphs, bodies of block text, labels, and accent text.
The `Body` typography can be implemented as an `HTMLParagraph` tag, `HTMLSpan` tag, or `HTMLLabel` tag.

<Canvas of={Stories.BodyMain} />

        At Meta, we've solved this problem by building React from the main branch, and manually updating it to a specific pinned commit every week. This is also the approach that React Native releases have been following for the last several years. Every stable release of React Native is pinned to a specific commit from the main branch of the React repository. This lets React Native include important bugfixes and incrementally adopt new React features at the framework level without getting coupled to the global React release schedule.
    </Body>
</RenderMetricsComponent>
